# Description

  * Wiki, What's BIC?

    The BIC (Business Identifier Code) is a unique address which in payment messages identifies precisely the Bank/Business (not the Branch) involved in a  financial transaction. When used in

    conjunction with the IBAN it identifies the bank at which the account of the beneficiary is held. A valid BIC can be  eight or eleven characters (9 - 11 characters). The optional three characters

    can be used by the Bank/Business to identify a branch. In some cases the suffix ‘XXX’ is displayed at the end of a BIC.
